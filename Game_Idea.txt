- The Quest for the rounded wheel:
  * Rouge-like strategy game
  * A world where everything is squared. But your people have heard the legendary tale of the rounded
    wheel, so you set out on a quest for the rounded wheel! However, you're not only one who's after the
    new groundbreaking technology.
  * Cube map
  * Warriors and workers
  * Move between areas where you stay for the whole day, and move on during the night
  * In each area you gather resources, figthing barbarians, meeting new people which can recruit and so on
  * You move around in a square wheeled vehicle, which deploys it self as a mobile city in each area 
  * If all members (villagers?) of your team dies, or you mobile base gets destroyed, you lose the game
  * Upgrades: You can upgrade your crew and base - only during an actual map, or/and as you move between areas?
  * Resource types:
    - Food: Determines how many villagers you can use in the given area, as each villager needs food for being active that day
    - Coal: Used as fuel to the mobile base (each area has coal travel cost)
    - Gold: Used for trading and bribing
    - Wood and Iron: Used for upgrading the base and equipment of the villagers
